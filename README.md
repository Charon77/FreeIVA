Technical demo 3. Not for use in normal gameplay.

When in IVA, press Y to switch between the buckled (standard) and unbucked (free) views (re-entering the seat is discouraged in this version). Hatches can be opened or closed by approaching them and pressing F. You can reach through an open hatch and open or close the hatch of the part it's connected to using Alt + F. Mouse look can be toggled using Alt + Y for using the GUI. Keys can be changed in settings.cfg. Interiors may not be shown for empty parts or after switching craft. The Mk1-2 pod and HitchHiker Storage Container now have solid walls and hatches. Enable NoClip in the collider setup GUI to pass through them.
